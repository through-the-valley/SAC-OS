## How to train

Your data path should be included in env classes. Please ensure your column names can match the settings in the code.

To instantiate an algorithm class, you need to pass in the corresponding training parameters. Then call the train method of the algorithm class.
The save path of the trainint results and the trained model is in algorithm classes which you can decide.
